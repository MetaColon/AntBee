# AntBee
Dive into the coolest, most exciting programming game the world has ever seen! Or, exaggerations aside: sit down and immerse yourself in a very interesting, useful and relevant game that teaches you how to write real, working code.

In AntMe! you take on the role of a whole ant colony. Search for food in a virtual world, battle dangerous bugs and defend your anthill from rival colonies. But you don't control your ants with a boring old mouse and keyboard combo. That's so last year. No - in AntMe! you use something far more powerful: real source code. You'll learn how to write real programs in real programming languages that tell all the ants in your colony how to act and what to do.
